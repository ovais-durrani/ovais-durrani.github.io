# The Day I Realized Manufacturing Security Was Broken

The Open Source Solution I'm Testing

## The Realization That Sparked This Project

Last month, I was talking to a manufacturing IT director. He said something that stuck with me:

> "We have 10 factories, each with its own Squid proxy. We're flying blind, and I know we're vulnerable."

That conversation sparked an idea: **What if I could build the perfect security setup in my own lab first?**

## The Problem (That You Probably Have Too)

Most manufacturing companies running distributed operations face:
1. **No visibility** into what's happening across branches
2. **Inconsistent security** (10 branches = 10 different configs)
3. **Business applications exposed** to internal threats
4. **No way to test improvements** without risking production

## My Crazy Plan

I decided to build a complete enterprise security lab that mimics:
- 10 "branch offices" (virtual networks)
- Real Business application simulations
- Full monitoring and analytics
- Zero-trust access controls

## Why This Matters to You

If you're responsible for manufacturing IT security, you're probably dealing with:
- [ ] Audit findings you can't easily fix
- [ ] Fear of changing anything (if it works, don't break it)
- [ ] Too many vendors, too little integration
- [ ] Budget constraints for "nice-to-have" security

## What's Coming Next

Over the next few weeks, I'll be sharing:
1. **Step-by-step configurations** (copy-paste ready)
2. **Real performance numbers** (what works, what doesn't)
3. **Automation scripts** (manage 16 branches like 1)

## Your Turn

**What's your biggest web security headache?**
- Is it managing multiple proxies?
- Securing internal applications?
- Meeting compliance requirements?
- Something else?
